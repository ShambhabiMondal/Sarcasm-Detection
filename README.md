# Sarcasm-Detection
This repository contains code to a somewhat basic neural network model trained to detect sarcasm, using TensorFlow. A news headlines dataset has been used to train this model.
<br><br>To obtain this dataset or for more information about it, refer to this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection).
<br><br>This model uses a combination of Dropout, Conv1D, MaxPooling1D and Bidirectional LSTM layers.
<br>It has an accuracy of about 84.5% on the testing dataset.
<br><br>This is a developing repository, and I'm in the process of experimenting with various neural network architectures, to create a functional hybrid model and increase efficiency.
